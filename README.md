# pretty-binaries

This repo is a nerdy take on art and creativity. The goal was to take some of my favorite computer programs and turn them into cool pictures that I could display on my wall. I ended up with some pretty nerdy pictures to display on my wall. For example, below is the prettified version of the *prettyify.py* program:

Enjoy!
